 Sistema de coment√°rios com login/register

 This project was created using the following technologies: TypeScript, MySQL, Handlebars and CSS.
 I used a lot of libraries too, like: BCryptJS, Validator, Express-Session...

 In this personal project, I created a website (like a social media) - where the users could create accounts, register, login, post something and comment.
 The most important thing that I learned, was the Foreign Key in MySQL. With the Foreign Key, I could adjust the users comments to the correct topic.

 If you want to test the project by yourself, you can download some code editor, like VSCODE - and download this whole project.
 Then, you can type on the terminal: npm run dev ./src/index.ts and enter the localhost.
