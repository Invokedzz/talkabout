 Sistema de comentários com login/register

This project was created using the following technologies: TypeScript, MySQL, Handlebars, Docker and CSS. I also utilized several libraries, including BCryptJS, Validator, and Express-Session.

In this personal project, I developed a social media-like website where users can create accounts, register, log in, post content, and comment on posts. One of the key things I learned was the importance of Foreign Keys in MySQL. By using Foreign Keys, I was able to link users' comments to the appropriate topics. And, I've learned a bit about Docker (although I find quite difficult :()

If you'd like to test the project yourself, download a code editor like VS Code and clone the project repository. Then, open the terminal and run the following command: npm run dev ./src/index.ts, and navigate to localhost in your browser.
